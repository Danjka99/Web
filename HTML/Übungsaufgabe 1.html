			<h1>Some Thoughts on Wingsuit Openings</h1>
			<article>
				<section>
					<p>Flying a wingsuit, if you’re ready for it, is pretty straightforward. It doesn’t take much effort: Just relax, look where you want to go, and fly it back to the DZ without hitting anything. The tricky part – the part that even some highly experienced skydivers still struggle with – is the deployment and opening of your parachute.

					This article is an attempt to collate some of what we know and have learned from testing both wingsuits and parachutes in recent years. This is what we think works best now, in 2016, and it may contradict some older stuff written by pudgy ponytail clowns. The techniques described here will, hopefully, eventually, be replaced by better techniques in the future. Such is the nature of progress and communication. Out with the old, in with the new!</p>
					<h2>The “pull” is the beginning of a process, not the end of one.</h2>
					<p>The most common mistake is to stop flying or controlling one’s wingsuit and body once the BOC reach begins. Reaching for the pilot chute and deploying it is the beginning of a process that needs your full and active participation.

					First and foremost, fly your body and your suit <i>symmetrically through the entire deployment process</i>. Whether you collapse everything or collapse nothing, you need to do it symmetrically, and in order to accomplish this, you have to maintain an awareness of your actions. Pitching out your PC and then going limp or just thinking “it’s over now” will not work. We see people “give up” on maintaining their heading, pitch control, and suit symmetry the moment they begin to reach back to their BOC. This could be the one moment of the flight where symmetry is most important.</p>
